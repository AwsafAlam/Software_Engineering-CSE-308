# Scenario

Apple CEO Tim Cook just announced the new Mac Book Pro 2018. Being an Apple fan myself I decided to buy one. However as soon as I opened the packaging I realized the new mac has only two USB-C ports. This provided a huge problem as I already had several USBv2.0 & USBv3.0 and other devices. This meant I had to buy various adapters and dongles that could make these devices functional again.

#### Some devices include:

1. Logitech mouse USBv2.0
2. Dell keyboard USBv2.0
3. 2TB HDD thunderbolt
4. Samsung 32" monitor
5. SD card reader
6. USB-C thumbdrive

I also need a way to plug in my Ethernet cable for *High Speed* internet and an extra USB-C port for charging my Mac.

*There are various dongles available in the market. Only 3 were sufficient to fullfill my needs. Each one had a various number of ports.*

-  Dongle-1 : (USBv2.0 , USBv3.0 , MacroSD , HDMI)
-  Dongle-2 : (USB-C , USBv2.0 , Ethernet , HDMI)
-  Dongle-3 : (USBv2.0 , USBv2.0 , Ethernet , HDMI)

A Software takes the device and Port as input & outputs the which Dongle to be used.
